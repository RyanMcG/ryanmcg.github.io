# Bio

My name is Ryan McGowan.
I am a graduate of The Ohio State University with a BS in Computer Science & Engineering.
After graduating I worked at a startup in Columbus, Ohio called [Facio][].
I then moved to Seattle and worked at [Amazon][] for a few years.

Now I'm living in the San Francisco Bay Area because it seemed like a good idea at the time. I work with the awesome people at [Lyft][].
More professional details about me can be found on [my résumé][resume] and on [LinkedIn][].

Most importantly, I live with my best friend Jenny and our dog Sirius.
Here is a photo of me and Jenny in [Canyonlands National Park](https://www.nps.gov/cany/index.htm).
