# Bio

My name is Ryan McGowan. I am a graduate of The Ohio State University with a
major in Computer Science & Engineering. After graduating I worked at a startup
in Columbus, Ohio called [Facio][]. More recently I have moved to
Seattle to work for [Amazon][]. More professional details about me can be found
on [my résumé][resume] and on [LinkedIn][].

More importantly, I live with my best friend Jenny and our dog Sirius. Here is a
picture of us.
