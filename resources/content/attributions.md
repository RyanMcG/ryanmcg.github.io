My thanks to the authors, maintainers and everyone who has contributed in any
way to the following projects for allowing me (and others) to stand on
their shoulders.

### CSS Framework

This website uses [purecss][] which uses the [Yahoo BSD
License](https://github.com/yui/pure-site/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

### Icons

This website uses the fantastic [Font Awesome][] by Dave Gandy. It is a [fully open
source][fa-license] icon font.

### Typefaces

This site uses two typefaces from [Brick](http://brick.im/).

##### 1. Heros

[TeX Gyre Heros][] is a excellent, open source, replacement for Helvetica under the [GUST Font License][GFL].

##### 2. Raleway

> [Raleway][] is an elegant sans-serif typeface family. Initially designed
> by Matt McInerney as a single thin weight, it was expanded into a 9
> weight family by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida in 2012 and
> iKerned by Igino Marini.
>
> It is a display face and the download features both old style and lining
> numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures, a pretty complete set of
> diacritics, as well as a stylistic alternate inspired by more geometric
> sans-serif typefaces than its neo-grotesque inspired default character
> set.

It uses [SIL][].
